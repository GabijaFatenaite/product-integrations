## How Datacenter Proxies work

Datacenter proxies are private proxies that are not affiliated with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Datacenter proxies come from a secondary corporation and provide you with a private IP authentication and a high anonymity level: their main benefit - rapid response times.
