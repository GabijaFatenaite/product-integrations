## How does it work

Data center proxies are private proxies that are not affiliated with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Data center proxies come from a secondary corporation and provide you with entirely private IP authentication and a high level of anonymity. The main benefit that data center proxies offer is rapid response times. 
Our Product Owner Nedas talks all about Data center proxies, and how Oxylabs can accommodate even the most diverse business requirements:
